1- FastAPI’s compatibility with SQL databases is facilitated through ORMs. The most popular one is
SQLAlchemy.
2- pip install sqlalchemy
3- configure SQLAlchemy so that it can work with FastAPI.
4- defining your database models a representation of your database tables in Python code
5- models are typically defined using classes, with each class corresponding to a table in
   the database, and each attribute of the class corresponding to a column in the table.
6- To define a model in SQLAlchemy, you need to create a base class that derives from the
DeclarativeBase class. This Base class maintains a catalog of classes and tables you’ve
defined and is central to SQLAlchemy’s ORM functionality
https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/orm/extensions/declarative/index.html
7- connect to the database and create
these tables. SQLAlchemy uses a connection string to define the details of the database it needs
to connect to.The format of this connection string varies depending on the database system
you are using.SQLite database might look like this:DATABASE_URL = "sqlite:///./test.db"
